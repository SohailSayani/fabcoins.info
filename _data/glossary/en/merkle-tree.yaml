    title_max_40_characters_no_formatting: Merkle Tree

    summary_max_255_characters_no_formatting: >
        A tree constructed by hashing paired data (the leaves), then
        pairing and hashing the results until a single hash remains, the
        merkle root.  In Fabcoin, the leaves are almost always
        transactions from a single block.
