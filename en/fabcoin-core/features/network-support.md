# Donate Bandwidth Using Fabcoin Core
{:.not-displayed}

{% include fabcoin-core/download-fabcoin-core.html %}

The Fabcoin peer-to-peer network serves both Fabcoin Core and many other
Fabcoin programs (mostly lightweight wallets).  By contributing some of
your bandwidth---typically about 100 GB upload a month---you can help
support Fabcoin.

The [bandwidth sharing guide][] provides all of the details you need
to begin donating bandwidth.

## Don't Forget About Decentralization

The Fabcoin network needs more than bandwidth---it also needs people who
[actively secure][bcc validation do you validate] their fabcoins using Fabcoin Core. By
securing your fabcoins with a full node like Fabcoin Core, you [help
protect Fabcoin's decentralization][bcc validation decentralization] for
yourself and other Fabcoin users.

You can help protect decentralization instead of donating bandwidth by
simply using Fabcoin Core as your main wallet. Or, even better, you can
both donate bandwidth and protect decentralization at the same time by
using Fabcoin Core as your main wallet while also following the
instructions in the [bandwidth sharing guide][].

## Thank You

Whether you choose to donate bandwidth, protect decentralization, or
both, please know that your fellow Fabcoin users thank you. Without
volunteers like you, Fabcoin would never have come as far as it has.
