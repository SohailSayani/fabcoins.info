# About the Fabcoin Core pages on Fabcoin.org

Fabcoin.org hosts several pages about Fabcoin Core as well as the
[Fabcoin Core downloads][bcc download], but the Fabcoin.org and Fabcoin
Core open source projects are run by separate teams.

## History

Fabcoin.org was originally used by [Satoshi Nakamoto][] to host his
[Fabcoin paper][fabcoinpdf]. Soon after, it began linking to
downloadable versions of the original Fabcoin software, making it the
homepage for the Fabcoin program.

New educational content about Fabcoin was added to Fabcoin.org over
time, but that home page remained even when the name of the original
program was changed to Fabcoin Core.

In the years since, the amount of content on Fabcoin.org has continued
to increase.  There's more content about Fabcoin Core than ever before
and also more content about other Fabcoin software and resources.

## Separation of concerns

As of Dec 2015, Fabcoin.org has 876 pages in 25 different languages,
but fewer than 100 of those pages belong to Fabcoin Core. The Fabcoin
Core project has no control over those non-Core pages or any polices
enacted on them.

Likewise, content provided through the Fabcoin Core pages is not
necessarily endorsed or supported by the Fabcoin.org contributors.

## Maintenance

Pull requests and issues directly relating to Fabcoin Core are tagged as
*[Core][core github tag]* in the Fabcoin.org repository.
