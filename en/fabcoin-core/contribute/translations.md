# Translating Fabcoin Core

Fabcoin Core has been fully translated into over two dozen languages,
with dozens more languages partially translated---but more help is
always needed.

To contribute a translation, create a [Transifex][transifex] account and
then go to the [Fabcoin Core translation page][fabcoin core transifex].
From there you can click the Join Team button near the top of the page.

After you've joined the team, find the language you want to help
translate.  Click on it and choose what Fabcoin Core release you want to
contribute to.

From the page listing a specific release, you can click the Translate
button.

On the Translation screen, click the Untranslated tab.  On the left pane
will appear the English versions of text that needs translating.  On the
right pane, you can enter your proposed translation.

After saving your translation, it will be reviewed and (if accepted)
included in the next release of that version of Fabcoin Core.

*If you have any questions, please contact the translation maintainers
listed on Transifex or ask (in English) in the [#fabcoin-dev][] IRC
chatroom.*
