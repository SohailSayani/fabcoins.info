# Supporting Fabcoin Core Users

This site tells Fabcoin Core users where they can [go to find help][bcc
help]---but that help is provided by volunteers like you. Many questions
are asked by complete newbies, so nearly everyone with any experience
using Fabcoin Core can provide help.

Before you start providing support, you may want to familiarize yourself
with the available [documentation][bcc documentation].

## Forums

The following forums are where we believe most users ask their Fabcoin
Core questions.

- [Fabcoin StackExchange][] is a community dedicated entirely to
  answering questions about Fabcoin and related technology.  Many
  questions about Fabcoin Core can be found under the [Fabcoin-Qt
  tag][fabcoin stackexchange tag fabcoin-qt]

- [FabcoinTalk Technical Support][forum tech support] is a
  sub-forum dedicated to providing help for Fabcoin Core and other
  Fabcoin programs.

- [/r/Fabcoin][fabcoin reddit] is a Reddit community that occasionally
  features questions about Fabcoin Core. Currently, very few questions
  receive enough upvotes to be featured on the front page, but you can
  always check the [new queue][fabcoin reddit new] or answer questions
  on the popular Mentor Monday thread (usually posted around noon UTC
  on Monday).

- [/r/FabcoinBeginners][fabcoin beginners] is a Reddit community that
  prominently features questions from inexperienced Fabcoin users.

## Live

Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is the most popular way to get live online
help with Fabcoin Core.  When providing links to documentation, most
chatrooms require you post full links (not links shortened using
services like TinyURL or Bit.ly).

The links below will get you started using an IRC web interface.  Many
serious IRC users use a [native IRC client][].

- [#fabcoin][] is where most users should ask general questions about
  Fabcoin Core.

- [#fabcoin-mining][] hosts discussion about Fabcoin mining, including
  decentralized mining using Fabcoin Core as part of the system.

- For more channels, please see the [comprehensive
  listing][irc channels] on the Fabcoin Wiki.
