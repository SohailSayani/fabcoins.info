Fabcoins.info is proud to announce the addition of a dozen new pages to
the site about [Fabcoin Core][].  Several of the pages describe [Fabcoin
Core's powerful features][], others [provide help][] for Fabcoin Core
users, and several make it easier to [start contributing][] to
Fabcoin Core.

Both Fabcoin Core and Fabcoins.info have come a long way since the site
began promoting the earliest public versions of the software.

These new pages give us a chance to introduce more recent Fabcoin users
to the advantages of full nodes like Fabcoin Core, particularly how full
validation [helps protect Fabcoin's essential decentralization][] from
takeover by a handful of miners, Fabcoin banks, and service providers.

## A Brief Guide to The New Pages

- [Fabcoin Core overview][]: provides a brief description of Fabcoin
  Core and links to the other sections of the sub-site.

- [Feature overview][]: briefly describes some of Fabcoin Core's
  leading benefits and links to pages that provide more details.

- [Get help page][]: resources to help Fabcoin Core users find help.
  Prior to this PR, we also created and filled a category on the Fabcoin
  Wiki with all the existing [Fabcoin Core help pages][].

- [Contribute overview][]: links to ways you can directly contribute to
  Fabcoin Core and Fabcoin Core users.

## Future Plans

We plan to enhance this new section of the Fabcoins.info website by
collecting together some of Fabcoin Core's disparate documentation and
providing instructions for important ways users can enhance their privacy and
security while using Fabcoin Coreâ€”such as using Tor and an offline
wallet.

In addition, we hope to provide more resources that help businesses
understand the benefits of validating the transactions they receive with
their own full nodes.

If you want to help, please feel free to email the Fabcoins.info
documentation maintainer,
