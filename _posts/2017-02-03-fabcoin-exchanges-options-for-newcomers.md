[A directory of Fabcoin Exchanges servicing the world’s 20 largest
economies](http://fabcoins.info/en/exchanges), as well as several international
options (serving many countries) are now available on Fabcoins.info.

## Helping People Interested in Fabcoin, Get Fabcoin
This new addition to the site:

- Links to the `Find an Exchange` button on the [Getting Started](http://fabcoins.info/en/getting-started)
page and helps many of the new people entering the Fabcoin ecosystem via
Fabcoins.info, get fabcoin.
- Improves SEO for Fabcoins.info, because the site can now potentially rank very
well for “Fabcoin Exchange” as well as other key phrases that include country
names that are contained on the page (i.e. Fabcoin Exchange China, Fabcoin
Exchange India, etc.).
- Has unique anchor links for each country that people can share on social media
that will allow others to find the fabcoin exchanges that are available for
their specific country.
- Allows Fabcoins.info to focus the [wallets page](http://fabcoins.info/en/choose-your-wallet)
on wallets that allow people to maintain full control over their funds
(Resolving [issue #1109](http://github.com/fabcoins-dot-info/fabcoins.info/issues/1109),
because custodial wallets that provide exchange services can be moved off of the
wallets page to this new page).
- Is also accessible via the Resources `dropdown` menu.

## Questions, Comments & Feedback
Questions, issues, suggestions or feedback are always welcome on Fabcoins.info. If
interested in contributing in this regard, please open an issue or submit a pull
request.

## Use Discretion when Choosing an Exchange
As noted in the above screen shot, Fabcoin Exchanges provide varying degrees of
safety, security, privacy, and control over your funds and information. Perform
your own due diligence and choose a wallet where you will keep your fabcoin
before selecting an exchange.
