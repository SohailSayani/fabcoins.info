title: Fabcoin-Qt version 0.8.6 released
---
Fabcoin-Qt version 0.8.6 is now available from:
  <http://sourceforge.net/projects/fabcoin/files/Fabcoin/fabcoin-0.8.6/>

This is a maintenance release to fix a critical bug;
we urge all users to upgrade.

Please report bugs using the issue tracker at github:
  <http://github.com/blockchaingate/fabcoin/issues>


How to Upgrade
--------------

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait
until it has completely shut down (which might take a few minutes for older
versions), then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over
/Applications/Fabcoin-Qt (on Mac) or fabcoind/fabcoin-qt (on Linux).

If you are upgrading from version 0.7.2 or earlier, the first time you
run 0.8.6 your blockchain files will be re-indexed, which will take
anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours, depending on the speed of
your machine.

  A 64-bit executable for Windows is planned for 0.9.
