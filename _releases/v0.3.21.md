title: Fabcoin version 0.3.21 released
---

Binaries for Fabcoin version 0.3.21 are available at:
  <http://sourceforge.net/projects/fabcoin/files/Fabcoin/fabcoin-0.3.21/>

Changes and new features from the 0.3.20 release include:

* Universal Plug and Play support.  Enable automatic opening of a port
for incoming connections by running fabcoin or fabcoind with the
- -upnp=1 command line switch or using the Options dialog box.
* Support for full-precision fabcoin amounts.  You can now send, and
fabcoin will display, fabcoin amounts smaller than 0.01.  However,
sending fewer than 0.01 fabcoins still requires a 0.01 fabcoin fee (so
you can send 1.0001 fabcoins without a fee, but you will be asked to
pay a fee if you try to send 0.0001).
* A new method of finding fabcoin nodes to connect with, via DNS A
records. Use the -dnsseed option to enable.

For developers, changes to fabcoin's remote-procedure-call API:

* New rpc command "sendmany" to send fabcoins to more than one address
in a single transaction.
* Several bug fixes, including a serious intermittent bug that would
sometimes cause fabcoind to stop accepting rpc requests. 
* -logtimestamps option, to add a timestamp to each line in debug.log.
* Immature blocks (newly generated, under 120 confirmations) are now
shown in listtransactions.
